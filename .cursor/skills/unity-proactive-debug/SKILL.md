# Unity proactive debug (Editor bridge + Play)

## When to use

- User wants **Play 模式**验证，且需要 **看得见 Game 视窗**（Unity 以**正常带界面**方式已打开工程）。
- User asks the agent to **发起 Play / 停止 Play**、确认 Editor 是否就绪。
- After editing Unity scripts, run a **quick bridge check** before deeper tests.

Do **not** use this skill for headless `-batchmode -nographics` CI; that is a separate workflow.

## Mandatory order (every debugging / Play verification session)

**Rule:** `ping`, `refresh_wait`, `enter_play`, and other bridge commands require the **TCP listener inside Unity**. That code runs only **after** the bridge `Editor` assembly has **compiled** and domain reload / `InitializeOnLoad` has run. **Never assume `ping` succeeds immediately** after writing the bridge file or after editing scripts — **compile first, then `ping`**.

1. **Ensure the bridge script exists** (run `ensure_unity_editor_bridge.py` below). Read JSON **`action`**: `created` | `already_present`.
2. **Unity Editor** open with that **same project** (user responsibility).

### A) Cold start — `ensure` just wrote the file (`action: "created"`)

The agent **cannot** call `refresh_wait` or any TCP command yet: Unity has **no listener** until it **imports and compiles** the new `CursorEditorDebugBridge.cs`.

- **Tell the user** to **switch to Unity Editor** with this project, let Unity **detect the new script**, and **wait until script compilation finishes** (progress bar / bottom status). If Unity was on another project or closed, they must **open this project** first. The agent **cannot** trigger Domain Reload from outside in this state.
- **Wait for compile**, then verify:
  - Prefer gentle **`ping`** retries with short backoff (e.g. a few seconds apart, bounded attempts), **or** inspect **`scan_unity_editor_log.py --json`** for fresh **`error CS`** / bridge **`Listening`** lines.
- **Only after** compilation succeeds (no blocking script errors): run **`ping`**. If `connect_failed`, **`scan_unity_editor_log.py --json`**, fix issues, ask the user to let Unity recompile, retry.

### B) Warm bridge — `action: "already_present"` and you only need to confirm Editor

- If Unity should already have the bridge loaded: run **`ping`** after you are confident the project has finished compiling (e.g. user has Unity focused, or prior step succeeded).
- If `connect_failed`, **`scan_unity_editor_log.py --json`**, then align with **A)** (user must get Unity to compile / reload) or **After editing Unity `.cs`** (below) if you just changed scripts.

### C) After the agent edits any `Assets/**/*.cs`

The bridge **must** already be reachable for `refresh_wait` (otherwise you are still in **A)** — user must compile in Unity first).

1. **`refresh_wait`** — forces refresh + compile on the main thread.
2. **`scan_unity_editor_log.py --json`** (large tail, e.g. `--tail 800`).
3. **`ping`** — confirms the bridge is up **after** compile / domain reload (not optional for this workflow).

Then `enter_play` / `menu` / etc. as needed. If `connect_failed` on `refresh_wait`, treat as bridge down → **A)** + log scan.

## Ensure bridge script (auto-create if missing)

- **Target path** (inside the Unity project): `Assets/Scripts/Editor/CursorEditorDebugBridge.cs`  
- **Why under `Editor/`**: uses `UnityEditor`; must not ship to player builds.

Run from shell (replace project root if needed):

```bash
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/ensure_unity_editor_bridge.py
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/ensure_unity_editor_bridge.py /path/to/UnityProject
```

- **Resolution order** for project root: optional CLI argument → env `UNITY_PROJECT_ROOT` → current working directory → walk upward until both `Assets/` and `ProjectSettings/` exist.
- **Output**: one JSON object; `action` is `created` | `already_present`.
- **Conflict**: if that path exists but is not the bridge (missing marker `public static class CursorEditorDebugBridge`), the script exits with error unless you pass **`--force`** (overwrites — use only when intentional).

On Windows PowerShell: `py -3` instead of `python` if needed.

## Prerequisites (agent checklist)

1. **Ensure** step completed for the correct Unity project (see above).
2. **Unity Editor** is running with the **correct project** open (user responsibility).
3. **Editor 调试桥**监听 `127.0.0.1:8742`（脚本编译成功后 `[InitializeOnLoad]` 自动启动）。协议见 [reference.md](reference.md)。
4. **Python 3** on PATH (stdlib only for scripts).

If the bridge is not running after ensure, **tell the user** to open or **focus** Unity and wait for compile. After **`action: "created"`**, spell out that **manual Editor attention** may be required the first time so Unity picks up the new file. Do not assume `-batchmode`.

## Unity Editor.log — automatic error check

When **`connect_failed`**, **`compile_timeout`**, **`refresh_failed`**, or the user asks what Unity is complaining about, **read the Editor log** before guessing.

**Default paths (do not hardcode `C:\Users\username\...`)**

| OS | Typical path |
|----|----------------|
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Unity\Editor\Editor.log` (e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Unity\Editor\Editor.log`) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Logs/Unity/Editor.log` |
| Linux | `~/.config/unity3d/Editor.log` or under `~/.local/share/unity3d/` |

**Override**: set env **`UNITY_EDITOR_LOG`** to the full file path if the log lives elsewhere.

**Agent command** (filters the tail for errors, exceptions, compile failures, and `CursorEditorDebugBridge` lines):

```bash
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/scan_unity_editor_log.py --json
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/scan_unity_editor_log.py --tail 800 --json
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/scan_unity_editor_log.py "D:/path/to/Editor.log"
```

- Use **`--json`** so the agent can parse `matched` lines and `path`.
- Human-readable mode: omit `--json`.
- Optionally use the **Read** tool on the same path for a manual tail if needed.

## After editing Unity `.cs` (mandatory: compile + Editor.log)

Whenever the **agent** changes any file under the Unity project’s **`Assets/`** (especially **`*.cs`**), do **all** of the following before claiming success or running Play/menu tests — **Unity must be open** with that project:

1. **`refresh_wait`** — forces refresh + compile on the main thread (no need to focus the Editor):

```bash
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/editor_bridge_client.py refresh_wait
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/editor_bridge_client.py refresh_wait 180
```

Second form sets max wait **seconds** (default `120`). On success, JSON includes `action: compile_idle`.

2. **`scan_unity_editor_log.py --json`** — immediately after step 1, scan a **large tail** (e.g. `--tail 800`) for **`error CS`** / **`Script Compilation Error`** / **`LogError`** in `matched`. If any **new** compile errors reference the files you edited, **fix them and repeat** steps 1–2 until the tail is clean (ignore stale older lines above the latest successful `Listening` / domain reload block).

3. **`ping`** — **required** after a successful `refresh_wait` + log scan to confirm the bridge is up again after domain reload.

- If **`compile_timeout`**: run **`scan_unity_editor_log.py --json`** first, fix errors, then `refresh_wait` again.
- If the **bridge `.cs` itself** was changed, TCP may drop briefly during reload; retry **`refresh_wait`** then **`ping`** if needed.

Lower-level (manual): `refresh` then poll `compile_status` in a loop.

## How to initiate Play (agent must run the client)

From the **Engine repo root** (or any cwd; use absolute path to the script):

```bash
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/editor_bridge_client.py ping
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/editor_bridge_client.py enter_play
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/editor_bridge_client.py exit_play
```

On Windows PowerShell, same commands if `python` is on PATH; otherwise use `py -3`.

**Environment (optional)**

- `UNITY_EDITOR_BRIDGE_HOST` — default `127.0.0.1`
- `UNITY_EDITOR_BRIDGE_PORT` — default `8742`
- `UNITY_EDITOR_BRIDGE_TOKEN` — if the Unity bridge requires auth, set to the same secret as in Editor

## Editor menus and custom static entry points

**Menus (preferred)** — runs `EditorApplication.ExecuteMenuItem` with the same path string shown in Unity’s menu bar (use `/`):

```bash
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/editor_bridge_client.py menu "Window/General/Test Runner"
```

Check JSON `result.executed`; if `false`, the path is wrong, the item is greyed out, or the menu is provided by a package that is not loaded.

**Static invoke (advanced)** — call a `public` or `private` **static** method with **no parameters** on a resolved type (full name such as `MyApp.EditorTools, Assembly-CSharp-Editor` may be required if `Type.GetType` alone fails; the bridge searches loaded assemblies by `FullName`):

```bash
python .cursor/skills/unity-proactive-debug/scripts/editor_bridge_client.py invoke_static MyNamespace.MyEditorHooks MySetupMethod
```

Prefer adding a `[MenuItem("Tools/MyProject/DoThing")]` wrapper that calls shared code, then use **`menu`** from the agent.

Full wire format for custom tools: `raw` JSON with `args` — see [reference.md](reference.md).

## Interpreting results

- Client prints **one line of JSON** per invocation (pretty-printed for humans).
- `ok: true` → command accepted on the Unity main thread.
- `ok: false` → read `error` / `message`; common causes: bridge off, wrong port, Play mode already in target state, domain reload in progress.
- **Ping** / **compile_status** return `result.isCompiling` when bridge supports it (see reference).
- **refresh_wait** returns a single summary object (not the same shape as a raw bridge line).
- **menu** / **invoke_static** return `result` shapes documented in [reference.md](reference.md). For **`menu`**, Unity may return **`ok: true`** but **`result.executed: false`** when the path is invalid or the item cannot run — always check **`executed`**.

## Workflow after code changes

1. **`ensure_unity_editor_bridge.py`** — script on disk (create if missing). Read **`action`**.
2. **If `action` is `created`:** instruct user to **use Unity Editor** (open/focus this project, wait for compile). **Do not** call `refresh_wait` yet. After compile, **`ping`** (with bounded retries / log scan as in **Mandatory order → A**). If `connect_failed`, **`scan_unity_editor_log.py --json`**, fix, user recompiles, retry **`ping`**.
3. **If the agent edited any `Assets/**/*.cs`:** **`refresh_wait`** → **`scan_unity_editor_log.py --tail 800 --json`** (fix **`error CS`** and repeat until clean) → **`ping`**.
4. **`enter_play`** — starts Play; user can watch Game view (when Play verification is in scope).
5. User or agent observes logs / behavior; **`exit_play`** when done.
6. If verification fails (`connect_failed`, `compile_timeout`, etc.), **`scan_unity_editor_log.py --json`**, fix code, then return to step 2 or 3 depending on whether the bridge file was just created or scripts were edited.

For **Editor-only** changes, skip **`enter_play`**; still run **`refresh_wait` → scan → `ping`** when **`.cs`** under `Assets/` was edited.

**Wrong order (avoid):** `ping` immediately after **`ensure`** when **`action` is `created`**, or **`ping`** before **`refresh_wait`** when the agent has just modified scripts.

## Extending commands

New commands require **both** Unity bridge handler and (optional) client subcommands. Protocol and C# notes: [reference.md](reference.md).
